*My first GitHub project + automation testing journey*

Welcome to **NRL Stats**!  
This is my very first public GitHub repository where I'm learning Git, GitHub, Python automation, and automated testing — all while working with real National Rugby League (NRL) data.

## 🚀 Project Goal
Automatically scrape, clean, and analyze NRL match statistics (player stats, team performance, ladder, etc.) and keep everything up-to-date using Python scripts and automated tests.

This project is as much about **learning modern development practices** as it is about rugby league stats!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools I'm Learning
- **Python** (my main language)
- **Requests** + **BeautifulSoup** / **Selenium** (web scraping)
- **Pandas** (data cleaning & analysis)
- **Pytest** (automated testing ← my first time using this!)
- **Git & GitHub** (version control, branching, pull requests)
- **GitHub Actions** (planning to add CI/CD later)
- Jupyter Notebooks (for exploration)
